NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite=true.

	// This is a UUID generated by the system for realizing the entity object. In most cases this should be same as 'unique_id' of the entity. However, in some cases this can be different because of entities have migrated thier unique identifier to NSX Policy intent objects later in the timeline and did not use unique_id for realization. Realization id is helpful for users to debug data path to correlate the configuration with corresponding intent. 
	RealizationId string `json:"realization_id,omitempty"`

	// Intent objects are not directly deleted from the system when a delete is invoked on them. They are marked for deletion and only when all the realized entities for that intent object gets deleted, the intent object is deleted.

	MarkedForDelete bool `json:"marked_for_delete,omitempty"`

	// If relax_scale_validation is true, the scale validations for virtual servers/pools/pool members/rules are relaxed for load balancer service. When load balancer service is deployed on edge nodes, the scale of virtual servers/pools/pool members for the load balancer service should not exceed the scale number of the largest load balancer size which could be configured on a certain edge form factor. For example, the largest load balancer size supported on a MEDIUM edge node is MEDIUM. So one SMALL load balancer deployed on MEDIUM edge nodes can support the scale number of MEDIUM load balancer. It is not recommended to enable active monitors if relax_scale_validation is true due to performance consideration. If relax_scale_validation is false, scale numbers should be validated for load balancer service. The property is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated. 
	RelaxScaleValidation bool `json:"relax_scale_validation,omitempty"`
	// Load balancer service size. The load balancer service sizes, SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE and XLARGE are all deprecated. Customers who are using this set of features are advised to migrate to NSX Advanced Load Balancer (Avi) which provides a superset of the NSX-T load balancing functionality. 
	Size string `json:"size,omitempty"`
