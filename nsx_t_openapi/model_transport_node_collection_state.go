If setting desired state of the transport node failed for any of the host then state will be \"FAILED_TO_CREATE\"  If realization of transport node failed for any of the host then state will be \"FAILED_TO_REALIZE\"  If Transport node is successfully created for all of the hosts in compute collection then state will be \"SUCCESS\"  You can override the configuration for one or more hosts in the compute collection by update TN(transport node) request on individual TN. If TN is successfully created for all hosts in compute collection and one or more hosts have overridden configuration then transport node collection state will be \"PROFILE_MISMATCH\".
