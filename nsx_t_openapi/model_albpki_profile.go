However, in some cases this can be different because of entities have migrated thier unique identifier to NSX Policy intent objects later in the timeline and did not use unique_id for realization. Realization id is helpful for users to debug data path to correlate the configuration with corresponding intent.

Special default for Basic edition is true, Essentials edition is true, Enterprise is False. Default value when not specified in API or module is interpreted by ALB Controller as true. 
	IgnorePeerChain bool `json:"ignore_peer_chain,omitempty"`
	// This field describes the object's replication scope. If the field is set to false, then the object is visible within the controller-cluster and its associated service-engines.
