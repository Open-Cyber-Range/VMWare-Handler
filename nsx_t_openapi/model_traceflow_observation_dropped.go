ARP_FAIL - ARP request fails for some reasons, please refer arp_fail_reason for detail BFD - BFD packet is dropped because traversed by non-operative interface or encountering internal error (e.g., memory insufficient) BROADCAST - Packet is dropped during traversing the interface (e.g., Edge uplink, Edge centralized service port) which disallow ethernet broadcast DHCP - DHCP packet is malformed DLB - The packet is disallowed by distributed load balancing FW_RULE - The packet matches a drop or reject rule of DFW or Edge firewall GENEVE - GENEVE packet is malformed GRE - GRE packet is malformed or traverses a non-operative interface IFACE - Packet traverses a non-operative interface IP - Packet is dropped because of IP related causes (e.g., ICMPv4/ICMPv6 packet is malformed, or DF flag is set but fragment must be performed for the packet) or corresponding interface is not found or inoperative IP_REASS - Packet is dropped during IP reassembly IPSEC - IPsec protocol related packet is dropped IPSEC_VTI - IPsec required SA is not found or traversing inoperative interface cause packet dropped L2VPN - VLAN id of GRE packet is invalid L4PORT - Layer 4 packet (e.g., BFD, DHCP) is dropped LB - Packet is dropped by load balancing rule LROUTER - Packet is dropped by logical router LSERVICE - Packet is malformed or traverses inoperative logical service interface LSWITCH - Packet is dropped by logical switch MANAGEMENT - Packet is dropped by Edge datapath MANAGEMENT service port MD_PROXY - Packet is dropped by metadata proxy NAT - Packet is dropped by NAT rule RTEP_TUNNEL - Unused drop reason ND_NS_FAIL - Neighbor Discovery packet fails NEIGH - ARP or Neighbor Discovery packet fails NO_EIP_FOUND - Destination IP is not an elastic IP NO_EIP_ASSOCIATION - Elastic IP is not associated with active edge VDR ENI NO_ENI_FOR_IP - There is no ENI found for the destination IP NO_ENI_FOR_LIF - Cannot find an ENI associated with uplink LIF NO_ROUTE - Cannot find route for destination IP NO_ROUTE_TABLE_FOUND - Cannot find associated route table NO_UNDERLAY_ROUTE_FOUND - Cannot find AWS route to destination NOT_VDR_DOWNLINK - Packet is not forwarded to VMC unmanaged VDR downlink NO_VDR_FOUND - VMC unmanaged VDR associated with Edge uplink is not found NO_VDR_ON_HOST - Cannot find VMC unmanaged VDR list on this host NOT_VDR_UPLINK - Packet is not forwarded to VDR uplink SERVICE_INSERT - Packet from guest VM to service VM or from service VM to guest VM is dropped by firewall rule SPOOFGUARD - Packet is blocked by SpoofGuard policy TTL_ZERO - The IPv4 time to live field or the IPv6 hop limit field of packet is zero TUNNEL - Overlay tunnel management packet (VNI value of GENEVE header is 0, e.g., BFD) is dropped VLAN - VLAN id of packet is disallowed by the given port VXLAN - VXLAN packet is malformed or cannot find tunnel port for it VXSTT - Unused drop reason VMC_NO_RESPONSE - Failed to query VMC observations as no response from VMC app WRONG_UPLINK - Packet is not routed to the expected Edge uplink by VMC unmanaged VDR FW_STATE - Packet is dropped by stateful firewall
