	// Epoch(in seconds) is auto updated based on system current timestamp when primary locale service is updated. It is used for resolving conflict during site failover. If system clock not in sync then User can optionally override this. New value must be higher than the current value. 
	LastAdminActiveEpoch int64 `json:"last_admin_active_epoch,omitempty"`
	// Primary egress site for gateway. T0/T1 gateway in Active/Standby mode supports stateful services on primary site. In this mode primary site must be set if gateway is stretched to more than one site. For T0 gateway in Active/Active primary site is optional field. If set then secondary site prefers routes learned from primary over locally learned routes. This field is not applicable for T1 gateway with no services.
