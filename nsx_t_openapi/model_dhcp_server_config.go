// DHCP server configuration. Please note, the realized-state of this entity returned by the \"GET /policy/api/v1/infra/realized-state/realized-entity\" with this entity policy-path is irrelevant with the application status of this entity.

The dhcp realization information was reflected in the realization states of the referencing Segment or T0/T1 gateway.
