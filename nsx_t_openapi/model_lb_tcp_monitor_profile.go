// Active healthchecks are disabled by default and can be enabled for a server pool by binding a health monitor to the Group through the LBRule object. This represents active health monitoring over TCP. Active healthchecks are initiated periodically, at a configurable interval, to each member of the Group. Only if a healthcheck fails consecutively for a specified number of times (fall_count) to a member will the member status be marked DOWN. Once a member is DOWN, a specified  number of consecutive successful healthchecks (rise_count) will bring  the member back to UP state. After a healthcheck is initiated, if it  does not complete within a certain period, then also the healthcheck is considered to be unsuccessful. Completing a healthcheck within timeout means establishing a connection (TCP or SSL), if applicable, sending the request and receiving the response, all within the configured timeout. LBTcpMonitorProfile is deprecated as NSX-T Load Balancer is deprecated.

	// The _revision property describes the current revision of the resource. To prevent clients from overwriting each other's changes, PUT operations must include the current _revision of the resource, which clients should obtain by issuing a GET operation. If the _revision provided in a PUT request is missing or stale, the operation will be rejected.

NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite=true.

	// There are two types of healthchecks: active and passive. Passive healthchecks depend on failures in actual client traffic (e.g. RST from server in response to a client connection) to detect that the server or the application is down. In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their health, completely independent of any data traffic. Currently, active health monitors are supported for HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols.

	// This is a UUID generated by the system for realizing the entity object. In most cases this should be same as 'unique_id' of the entity. However, in some cases this can be different because of entities have migrated thier unique identifier to NSX Policy intent objects later in the timeline and did not use unique_id for realization. Realization id is helpful for users to debug data path to correlate the configuration with corresponding intent. 
	RealizationId string `json:"realization_id,omitempty"`
	// Path relative from its parent
	RelativePath string `json:"relative_path,omitempty"`
	// This is a UUID generated by the GM/LM to uniquely identify entites in a federated environment. For entities that are stretched across multiple sites, the same ID will be used on all the stretched sites.

	Children []ChildPolicyConfigResource `json:"children,omitempty"`
	// Intent objects are not directly deleted from the system when a delete is invoked on them. They are marked for deletion and only when all the realized entities for that intent object gets deleted, the intent object is deleted. Objects that are marked for deletion are not returned in GET call. One can use the search API to get these objects. 
	MarkedForDelete bool `json:"marked_for_delete,omitempty"`
	// Global intent objects cannot be modified by the user. However, certain global intent objects can be overridden locally by use of this property. In such cases, the overridden local values take precedence over the globally defined values for the properties.

	Interval int64 `json:"interval,omitempty"`
	// Typically, monitors perform healthchecks to Group members using the member IP address and pool_port. However, in some cases, customers prefer to run healthchecks against a different port than the pool member port which handles actual application traffic. In such cases, the port to run healthchecks against can be specified in the monitor_port value. For ICMP monitor, monitor_port is not required. 
	MonitorPort int32 `json:"monitor_port,omitempty"`
	// Once a member is DOWN, a specified number of consecutive successful healthchecks specified by rise_count will bring the member back to UP state. 
	RiseCount int64 `json:"rise_count,omitempty"`
	// Timeout specified in seconds.  After a healthcheck is initiated, if it does not complete within a certain period, then also the healthcheck is considered to be unsuccessful. Completing a healthcheck within timeout means establishing a connection (TCP or SSL), if applicable, sending the request and receiving the response, all within the configured timeout. 
	Timeout int64 `json:"timeout,omitempty"`
	// Expected data, if specified, can be anywhere in the response and it has to be a string, regular expressions are not supported. 
	Receive string `json:"receive,omitempty"`
	// If both send and receive are not specified, then just a TCP connection is established (3-way handshake) to validate server is healthy, no data is sent. 
	Send string `json:"send,omitempty"`
