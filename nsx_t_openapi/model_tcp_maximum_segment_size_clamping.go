// TCP MSS Clamping Direction and Value.
type TcpMaximumSegmentSizeClamping struct {
	// Specifies the traffic direction for which to apply MSS Clamping. 
	Direction string `json:"direction,omitempty"`
	// MSS defines the maximum amount of data that a host is willing to accept in a single TCP segment. This field is set in TCP header during connection establishment. To avoid packet fragmentation, you can set this field depending on uplink MTU and VPN overhead. This is an optional field and in case it is left unconfigured, best possible MSS value will be calculated based on effective mtu of uplink interface. Supported MSS range is 216 to 8960. 
	MaxSegmentSize int64 `json:"max_segment_size,omitempty"`
